Users may encounter various errors related to LogonUI.exe, such as issues with the login process, crashes, or system freezes, which can often be resolved by performing system repairs or updates. It is advisable to run antivirus scans if suspicious behavior related to this file is detected, as this could indicate the presence of a malicious variant disguised as the legitimate LogonUI.exe.
